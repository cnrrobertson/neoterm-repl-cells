# nvim-repl-cells
Utility functions to add/remove/navigate/visual select "cells" of code in Neovim based on a marker between the cells.

## TODO:
- [x] Add language specific settings capability
  - [x] Different markers
  - [ ] `%paste -q` for ipython (or better yet, output like codi.vim in output pane or virtual text)
    - [x] Also pasting in other terminals, i.e. julia, in specific register
    - [ ] Explore other concise paste options for repls via `paste_cmd` language option (eval(Meta.parse("begin\n"*clipboard()*"\nend")) wrapped in for julia for example)
  - [x] language specific REPL commands and flags
- [x] Options flush out
  - [x] Colors for highlighting
  - [x] Default mappings
  - [x] Setup function
- [ ] Additional terminal functionality
  - [x] Show or don't show terminal on send commands
  - [x] Possibly manipulate buffers as objects/classes from toggleterm rather than high-level commands
    - [ ] Name buffer terminals buffer name
    - [ ] Direct stdout of terminal channels to virtual text or "output pane" like codi.vim in case they only want to see output from the terminal
      - https://neovim.io/doc/user/channel.html#on_stdout
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Comment lua functions

  - [ ] vimdoc

  - [ ] Fill out readme with feature gifs
- [ ] Fill out this README with overview of workflow that it supports and other alternative plugins
  - `jupytext.vim`: how it works well with this for jupyter notebooks
  - `vim-ipython-cell`: this was the inspiration. Doesn't depend on `vim-slime` and is `lua` only
  - `vim-jukit`: also an inspiration. Again, not buffer specific
  - `jupyter-vim`: complicated setup, not easy for remote work, etc.
  - `magma-nvim`: amazing plugin, complex, harder to debug because of hidden repl, images don't always work, lots of `python`
  - `nvim-ipy`: awesome, again, hard to access repl info, limited cell features, in `python`
  - `jupyter_ascending.vim`: separate process issues
  - `iron.nvim`: could work in combination with this but doesn't have buffer specific repls
  - `termwrapper.nvim`: same
  - `nvim-repl`: same
  - `nvim-python-repl`: same
  - `repl.nvim`: same
  - `neoterm`: same
  - `vimcmdline`: same
  - `vim-slime`: need to deal with separate process. Could work with the cell convenience commands
  - Example similar: https://www.maxwellrules.com/misc/nvim_jupyter.html
  - `vim-textobj-hydrogen`: text object for code cells, very similar to this, but not `lua`, inspiration
  - `codi.vim`: Nice repl that displays output (could be a nice feature)
